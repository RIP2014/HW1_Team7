To briefly touch on pathfinding through potential field navigation, the titular "potential field" represents a field created by both obstacles and the goal which guides the bot through the area. Obstacles, in addition to being impossible for the bot to traverse, have a field around them which repells the bot, guiding it away from individual obstacles and clusters of them. The goal, on the other hand, provides a constant attraction to the bot, guiding it forward. Working together with the obstacles repelling the bot, this can be viewed similarly to sliding down a hill, where the obstacles are very tall and have slopes around their base. The bot merely follows the path of least resistance. It is not a complete algorithm, however. In addition to depending on knowledge of the environment, it is possible for the bot to become stuck at local minima. Convex configurations of obstacles can create points where there is no way to escape in a downward direction, which will cause the greedy path of least resistance dependence to never reach the actual lowest point at the goal.
