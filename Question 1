The bug 1 and 2 algorithms are basic techniques of motion planning that rely on tracing a path around obstacles by following the edges of them. They both start by following a path directly to the goal, and following the edge of the first obstacle they hit. Bug 1 will keep record of the closest along the obstacle it has come to reaching the goal, and circumnavigates the entire surface before following the wall back to the closest point, before finally detaching and moving towards its goal again. In passing a simple set of 2 obstacles, it achieved a 2.72 ratio of distance traveled to distance between the start and goal. In a more complex layout of obstacles, its ratio slowed to 13 as it circled a shape with a large surface area one and a half times.
Bug 2, on the other hand, will jump off the obstacle whenever it comes into contact with the m-line (the direct path from start to goal), attempting to save time by taking a more greedy approach. This was effective in the simple layout, reducing the ratio to 2.01, but in the complex obstacle, its greed was its downfall, as it had nothing stopping it from circling the complex surface several times, bringing the ratio up to a horrifying 65.83.
